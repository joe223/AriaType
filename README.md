## What It Is

AriaType is a local-first voice typing app for macOS and Windows.

It stays in the background. When you want to type, hold a global hotkey, speak naturally, and release. Your speech becomes text in the current app. Think of it as an AI voice keyboard you can use all day for docs, chat, notes, coding, and any workflow where speaking is faster than typing.

## Core Features

- ⚡️ **Fast** – average transcribe duration under 500ms, boost your vibe coding/writing
- 🔒 **Privacy-first** – local STT/Polish by default, your voice never leaves your device
- 🎙 **Two shortcuts** – `Cmd+/` for dictation (raw), `Opt+/` for polished output
- 🇨🇳 **CJK-friendly** – SenseVoice optimized for Chinese, Japanese, Korean
- ✨ **Smart polish** – remove fillers, fix punctuation, clean up phrasing automatically
- 🧩 **Custom templates** – create your own polish styles for recurring tasks
- 🌍 **100+ languages** – auto-detect or specify output language
- ☁️ **Optional cloud** – BYO API key for stronger recognition when needed

## Usage Tips

- For Chinese/CJK workflows, start with `SenseVoice` – best fit for Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese.
- For English/international languages, start with `Whisper` – wider language coverage.
- For casual speech, transcribe first then apply `Remove Fillers` or `Make Concise`.
- For domain-specific terms, set glossary and output language in advance.
